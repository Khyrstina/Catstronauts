            <p>Meet Apollo, the adventurous male tabby with dreams that soar beyond the stars! With his enchanting green eyes and a majestic fur coat reminiscent of the lunar landscape, Apollo is a feline on a missionâ€”to journey to the moon! He spends his days gazing at the night sky, mesmerized by the twinkling celestial bodies, yearning to be among them. Energetic and playful, Apollo's boundless curiosity and fearless spirit make him the ultimate explorer. Whether he's leaping from one surface to another or chasing after elusive shadows, Apollo's determination to reach the moon is as unwavering as his captivating purr. He's ready to embark on an out-of-this-world adventure and prove that even a small tabby can dream big and touch the moon's gentle glow. ðŸŒŒðŸŒ• </p>

                <h3>Perseverance Image Retrieval</h3>

                <p>My human also loves learning about space. She made a project to be able to view the newest photos from the Perseverance rover. It's pretty cool, however I would rather just go there myself. It can't be that hard. Have you seen how high I can jump? Just a bit more practice and I'm sure I can get to the moon in no time. Maybe I'll try after my 5th nap of the day. </p>
